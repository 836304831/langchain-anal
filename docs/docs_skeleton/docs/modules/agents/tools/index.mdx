# Tools

Tools are interfaces that an agent can use to interact with the world.

## Get started

Tools are functions that agents can use to interact with the world.
These tools can be generic utilities (e.g. search), other chains, or even other agents.

Currently, tools can be loaded with the following snippet:

import GetStarted from "@snippets/modules/agents/tools/get_started.mdx"

<GetStarted/>
